Hi. My name is Matthew.

A recent transplant to the Bay Area, I used to work as a management consultant in London, focusing on procurement and operational excellence. Prior to that, I completed my PhD in German Literature. You can view my [resume](/public/posts/files/Resume.pdf), or check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewmccarthyrechowicz/).

I post data analysis workbooks made using Jupyter Notebooks, SQL, pandas and matplotlib, as well as Tableau visualizations. My visualizations are also viewable on my [Tableau profile](https://public.tableau.com/profile/matt2092#!/).

If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me at matthewmcre@gmail.com.
