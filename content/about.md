Hi. My name is Matthew. I post bits of data analysis I do using SQL in Google Colab notebooks.

A recent transplant to the Bay Area, I used to work as a management consultant back home in London, focusing on procurement and operational excellence. Prior to that, I completed my PhD in German Literature.
