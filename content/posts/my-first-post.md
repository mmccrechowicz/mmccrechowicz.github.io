My name is Matthew and this is my website where I'll be posting bits and pieces of data analysis using SQL in Google Colab notebooks. A recent adopter of SQL, this is my space to play, learn and experiment with data analysis using interesting datasets I find online.

Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to get in touch if you found this interesting!
